# FantaTech

Open-source engine and tools for _Neon Genesis Evangelion: Girlfriend of Steel (Special Edition) (2006, PC)_.

File formats from the 1997 game are also supported to a lesser extent.

## Status

Very WIP. It cannot load game scenes yet.

I normally don't like to dump half-baked software on Github, but the command-line tool for packing/unpacking game files is complete enough to be useful.
